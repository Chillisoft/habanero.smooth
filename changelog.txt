Habanero Smooth Change log

For use of Smooth please see the sample projects included in the source code zip.

v1.3 - 17 September 2010

Built against Habanero Core 2.5.0
#812 - Determine the DeleteParentAction of a RelationshipDef based on its RelationshipType for OneToOne Rels
- If relationship is Aggregation or Composition then DeleteParentAction should be set to Prevent.
- If defined as Association or reverse relationship defined as Composition or Aggregation then DeleteParentAction = DoNothing.
#813 - Determine OwningBOHasForeignKey based on RelationshipType for One To One Relationships
   If there are no FK props defined on either BusinessObject then the Automapping must determine where the ForeignKeys should be created. 
   In this case the following guideline is followed:
   - If Composition or Aggregation then Create FK Props on Related Class.
   - If Defines as Association then Create FKProps on OwnerClass.
   - If reverse relationship defined as Composition or Aggregation then create on OwnerClass.
#850 - AutoMapping of unique constraints. Smooth now maps unique constraints (known as keys in Habanero Core) if you mark properties with the AutoMapUniqueConstraint attribute.
#851 - IdentiyAutoMapper should be called IdentityAutomapper (spelling)
